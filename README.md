# IOF XML Tool

This tool is mainly for calculating cup results of an orienteering series. It uses IOF XML v3.0 format as input. The output can be rendered as HTML and JSON. It's based on .NET core v3.1 and thus can be run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

### Motivation
This tool started as cup calculator and was equally motivated by
+ learning F#
+ automatic calculation of our regional orienteering cup based on result exports from timing software

### Plans, Ideas
A lot more use cases are possible with the current basic infrasturcture, i.e.
+ inplement a GUI for the tool
+ enhance PDF rendering
+ split time analysis (analog to winsplits)
+ graphical representation of race result (analog to SplitsBrowser)
+ race result presentation mode
